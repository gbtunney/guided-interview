## guided-interview 🐌

This repository contains resources and documentation for a **conversational, AI-guided interview process**
designed to help users create field, object, and data specifications. The goal is to simplify the process of
defining attributes and their types while maintaining flexibility and adaptability across different systems,
platforms, and contexts.

## Key Features

- **Human-First Approach**: A conversational interview process with suggested options and defaults.
- **Three Type Layers**: Focus on **Conceptual**, **Technical**, and **User Interface** types to ensure
  flexibility and prevent premature coupling.
- **Dynamic Flows**: Supports multiple starting points, such as data-first, UI-first, or intent-first
  approaches.
- **TypeScript-First Output**: Generates clean, TypeScript-ready specifications.
- **Platform-Agnostic**: Designed to work across various platforms and use cases.

## Repository Structure

- **`notes/knowledge_base/`**: Contains detailed documentation, including:
  - **`FoundationalTypeLayers.md`**: Explains the three foundational type layers.
  - **`VocabularyAndCheatsheet.md`**: A technical vocabulary and TypeScript cheatsheet for types and
    constraints.
  - **`PlanAiGuidedInterview.md`**: The guided interview specification and flow design.

## Getting Started
